# github-issue-exporter

Simple Groovy-based Issue Exporter for GitHub

## Example Output

This is example out from running an issue search for: `"repo:elastic/elasticsearch" "type:issue" "is:open" "label::Analysis" "label:discuss"`. It would be written to a file named `8235.txt`.

Title: Compound words filter operator
Body:

# Compound words
### Ranking and operator type issue

Given the keyword "shoerack" was misspelled into one word, then I would expect it to be split into:

    "shoerack", "shoe" and "rack"

Using this compound word list:

    ["shoe", "rack"]

This all works fine. Testing the analyzer returns the above as expected. When I continue to perform the search after this the keywords appear to be searched this way, when I have the operator set on the multi_match query to be AND:

    "shoerack" || "shoe" || "rack"

I would like these keywords to act as they are searched for this way:

    "shoerack" || ("shoe" && "rack")

I would like the second argument to be ranked separately

I'm looking for a way to set up an operator in the filter itself to be AND, or maybe it isn't aware at all that the two or more keywords belong together.

I think this might be a feature request or enhancement, however it might be doable already, just that I have not found a solution to it.

Thanks

# Requirements

- GitHub account
- Java 7+ Installed

# Setup

Create a file in your home directory `.github` that looks like:

```properties
login=YOUR_USERNAME
password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

# Running

In order to run it, you need to build from source, which is done automatically for you by running the commands below.
The first command compiles the code and places the compiled files in the `build` directory. No files are ever written
outside of the current directory.

After building it, you simply need to run it.

You need to replace `"repo:OWNER/REPO"` with the repository details that you intend to search. For example, if you
wanted to search [elastic](https://github.com/elastic)'s [elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch)
repository, then you would change this to `"repo:elastic/elasticsearch"`.

## Linux / Mac OS X

```
$ ./gradlew installApp
$ build/install/github-issue-exporter/bin/github-issue-exporter "repo:OWNER/REPO" "type:issue" "is:open"
```

## Windows

```
> gradlew installApp
> build\install\github-issue-exporter\bin\github-issue-exporter "repo:OWNER/REPO" "type:issue" "is:open"
```

Once you have run it, you can check this folder for `*.txt` files. There will be one per issue found.

## Searching for issues

Each argument passed to `github-issue-exporter` (the quoted parts following it above) [follows the syntax set by
GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-issues). For example, `"label:your-label"` would limit the
search to issues that are labeled with `your-label`. You could further limit the search by adding another label, such
as `"label:your-label" "label:your-other-label"`.

## Searching for pull requests

You can also use this tool to search for pull requests by changing `"type:issue"` to `"type:pr"`. You can search for
both open and closed issues by removing the search term entirely.

## Searching for closed issues

You can search for closed issues by changing `"is:open"` to `"is:closed"`. You can search for both open and closed
issues by removing the search term entirely.
